1. prepare rootfs: =docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -=
2. prepare config.json: =runc spec=
3. run container: =runc run container-id=


Lifecycle of container

2. running: =runc start container-id=
3. deleted: =runc delete container-id=


Useful command

- list all container: =runc list=


Rootless container

1. prepare config.json: =runc spec --rootless=
