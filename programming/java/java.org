* heap vs stack memory

https://www.journaldev.com/4098/java-heap-space-vs-stack-memory

Heap memory
- JRE manage heap space memory
- new object will allocate memory from heap space
- Garbage collection revokes the unrefered memory back to heap

Stack memory
- used for the execution of a thread
- short-lived values
- referenced in LIFO order



Differences between heap and stack memory
1. stack is used only by one thread of execution
2. object is placed in heap while the reference (variable) is in stack space. The primitive variable is always in stack space
3. heap memory is divided into young-generation, old-generation, etc.
4. use -Xms and -Xmx to specify the startup size and maximum size of heap memory; use -Xss to define the stack memory size
5. StackOverFlowError vs OutOfMeoryError exception
6. stack memory size is very less compared to heap memory. 


* on heap vs off heap memory

off heap memory includes
1. thread stacks
2. application code
3. NIO buffers

* TODO java garbage collection
