#+BEGIN_QUOTE
No mater what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to
reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of
domains that you did before.
#+END_QUOTE

Breaks down barriers
- eliminate the old pitfalls (memory mamangement, concurrency, data representation)
- providing a friendly, polished set of tools
- guide you naturally towards reliable code, efficient in terms of speed and memory usage
- introduce parallelism with low-risk

* introduction

Over all of Rust
- help you write faster, more reliable software
- high-level ergonomic with low-level control support

** Who Rust is For

- teams of developers: compiler can detect elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs
  + cargo: dependency manager and build tool
  + rustfmt: format to certain coding style
  + IDE integration
- student: to learn about operation system development
- companies: cli, web service, devops tool, embedded device, audio/video analysis, IoT, matchines learning
- open source developer
