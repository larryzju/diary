** PIP

PIP (Python Package Index) is tool to fetch package (and its dependencies) from PyPI repository.
Which is simliar to gem fetch packages from RubyGem.

By default, PIP install packages into global site-packages directory. 

Python has another tool named =easy_install= and we should use PIP because it is vastly superior to =easy_install=

*** requirements

List the required packages information in =requirements.txt= and install by =pip install -r requirements.txt=

** virtualenv

Virtualenv tool is used to create a completely isolated virtual environment for each of your program.

It's useful in the scenario that multiple python projects that have different (and conflicting) requirements, to
coexist on the same computer.

The steps to use =virtualenv= are
1. create new peoject: =virtualenv venv=
2. enable virtual environment: =source venv/bin/active=
3. install packages and run python: =pip install -r requirements=
4. quit the virutal environment: =deactive=
