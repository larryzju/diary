* generate

=go generate= command will scan project for comments begin with
=//go:generate= and execute the command to generate go source code.

It can be used with =goyacc=, =gomock= or =stringer= module.

Basically it is very important for a computer program to write a
computer program (Turing Completeness)

=go build= will *not* call =go generate=. We *must* call =go generate=
command explicitly before build the package.
