* Condition

- =-r= :: readable
- =-f= :: regular file test


* Sed

- =basename= :: =echo $0 | sed -e 's:^.*/::'=

* OS

- =uname -s= :: return "Linux", "SunOS" ..
- =uname -r= :: linux kernel version, such as =3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64=

* Special Variable

- =$#= :: parameters' count
* Process

Processes makes up a tree. Each process has its own environment.

It takes two steps to execute a program:
1. make a copy of bash itself (fork), this will inherit environment of bash
2. replace with program itself

Bash defines its variable by ~NAME=VALUE~ which cannot be seen from
subprocess. But we need to =export= the variable to environment.

Bash would spawn new subshell in following scenarios:
1. execute command (use =source script= to import code rather than execute script)
2. pipe
3. subshell. For example, ~(subcommand) >output.txt~
4. command substitution: ~A=$(cat /etc/passwd | wc -l)~

Two ways to check variables:
1. =set=: list shell variables
2. =env=: list environment variables (only variables been exported)
