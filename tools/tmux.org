* Concept

Tmux server manage session in background which can be attached by tmux
client.

A *session* is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the
management of tmux.

Each session has one or more window linked to it. A window occupies
the entire screen and may be split into rectangle *pane*.

Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same sessions. (Share
windows by multiple tmux client)
