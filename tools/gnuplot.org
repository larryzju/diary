Here's a sample source file to draw three metrics with lines into a same image.

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot
set datafile separator comma;
set xdata time;
set timefmt "%Y%m%d%H%M%S";
set xrange ["202012071000":"202012090200"];
set yrange [-5:70];
set term png enhanced transparent size 2000,600 font "arial,18";
set output "azure-disk-latency.png";
set xlabel "timestamp";
set ylabel "latency (ms)";
unset border;

plot 'latency.csv' using 1:2 with lines title "Standard",\
     '' using 5:6 with lines lw 1.8 title "StandardSDD",\
     '' using 9:10 with lines lw 2 title "Preminum";
#+END_SRC

- data are read from local file: =set datafile= set the file format
- =set timefmt= customize the timestamp format when serialize or deserize data. Don't forget the =set xdata time=
- adjust the looks of the plot with =xrange=, =yrange=, =term=, =outupt=, =xlabel=, =ylabel=, '=border='
- plot lines from data of the csv file with different color and legend
