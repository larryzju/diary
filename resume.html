<h2 id="org6d4b50c">Self introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6d4b50c">
<p>
OK. It's my honor to introduce myself to you. My name is Zhao WenBin. I was born and raised in Gansu province and worked as a programmer and software engineer for about six years after graduation.
</p>

<p>
I got my bachelor of engineer in the year 2011 from Zhejiang University. My major is the Information Science and Electric Techonology. I finished my studies and 
 had been trained with strict mathmatic and logical. The most significant knowlege and expreience I had learned from school is the ability of self-teach. And also I learned computer theory and programing practice in the class. I used to be passionated on playing Linux and coding.
</p>

<p>
My first employee is the TP-LINK Technology co., as a software engineer of the enterprise router. I loved that career very much. As the first job, I had learned the principle of team work and consolidated the knowledge about the system programming and computer science and c programming language. I have learned a lot of things about operation system, compiler, multiproess, communication of process or thread, how to use version control system, how to communicate via email.
</p>

<p>
I was responsbile for many modules such as the PPPoE, PPP, UPnP and web CGI in the project of ER6520. I particapted in the migration from vxWorks to Linux. And then I used to maintain the network stack of PPP/PPPoE/PPTP and so on, which was shared by all the project and teams. I read the RFC manual and read almost the source code of the vxWorks or Linux network stack and something else. That is very hard but interest.
</p>

<p>
And I had do some research about the TCP Congest Control and the Asymmetric Accelerate algorithm that is related about the machenise.
</p>

</p>

<p>
And I had do some research about the TCP Congest Control and the Asymmetric Accelerate algorithm that is related about the mechanism.
</p>


<p>
By then, I had to resign for some personal reason in Apr. 2013, and find the my presnt job in the next year in Xi'an.
</p>

<p>
My current job is the big data software engineer in the Tenth Research Institute of Telecommunication Techonlogy. I will have workd for 4 years until April. 
</p>

<p>
Our applications and platform is applied in the public safty domain spreadly. And I learned and refactor the workflow of platform and ETL in my first year on this title, with my experience of C development. By then, I lead a team about ten colleagues to try to migrate our platform and business application from the Oracle to Hadoop clusters which used hive warehouse and hbase to provide the query and analysis. After one years coding and tunning we released the final platform and upgraded dozens platform over the country.
</p>

<p>
As we are family with most component of the Hadoop ecosystem, such as Apache kafka, storm, spark, oozie, mapreduce, elasticsearch, and the platform can fullfill the basic requirement to query and analysis. I was asked to designed a new BI Framwork and Modeling system in my third year. It was a framework to integrate diversity data sources and provide high level abstract api that other programmers and analysts can built their business code over it. I choose Clojure as the main programming language, and use Spark as the compute engine and persuaded my teams to co-worked. And we succeed release the versions and make new release in 2-3 months.
</p>

<p>
I have learned a lot things about the Big Data. And had helped others to maintained 13+ clusters. There clusters is spread over the country, and had nodes from 20 to 300. The biggest cluster can process about 8TB raw data per data. For the convient and automate I had written some scripts or programs in Python, C, Golang and Clojure to reduce the repeated manual operation. They were also been used for many project beside our project.
</p>

<p>
There were many tiny project I have particated I skipped. I like to hikling, climbing the mountains and swimming in the weekend. I used to swim from May to Nov. every year. I also try to learn and play violin for enterment. It's just a hob by not professional as the musical. I'd like to explore every thing I haven't met yet.
</p>

<p>
That all. Thanks for listening!
</p>






<p>
My name is Zhao Wenbin and I am currently working in the Tenth Institute of Telecommunication Technology in Xi'an.
</p>

<p>
I had graduated from Zhejiang University in 2011. My major is information and electric engineering. In my college, I were obsessed on programming and electronic design. I used linux when I got my laptop when I was Freshman, and spend much time to explore and played with linux.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this work, I was engaged in Enterprise Router Product ER6520 at TP-LINK in Shenzhen for two years. Mainly for the data link layer and application development, such as PPP, PPPoE, web service, and UPnP modules. And is responsible for the maintenance and development of PPP related protocol stacks. And also research on TCP asymmetric acceleration algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Now I am a big data engineer. Our application and platform is mainly for ​​public safety. We Migrate legacy databases and business models to the hadoop cluster (and also dozens of tools, such as Spark, Ooize, Kafka, Storm). In addition to writing  code, I had particated in the the system framework design, cluster planning, performance tuning and operation and maintenance do related work. Also meeting with our big data platfrom partner Transwarp.
</p>

<p>
I am very interested in programming languages ​​and operating systems. Self taught a lot of languages, and try to learn and read linux and other operating system source code.
</p>

<p>
Have a good self-learning ability, used to reading English technical documents, like to explore new and interesting things.
</p>

<p>
I bellieve focus is the best solution, and also I trained self-awareness all the time.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb2e98e6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb2e98e6">Why leave?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb2e98e6">
<p>
我很喜欢当下作为大数据工程师的工作，因为可以接触到真正的海量数据，并在一定规模的集群上来验证和写代码
</p>

<p>
但是我的公司管理比较混乱。我不得不花大量的时间来进行文档编写、业务演示以及运维工作。
</p>

<p>
我不喜欢这种无效率的加班，经常被打断和长期出差的节奏
</p>

<p>
我希望能专注于研究确定的方向，有比较好的节奏，也能够平衡工作与生活。也希望能有和更优秀的人学习，不断充实和提高自己
</p>


<p>
I really like my current job as a big data engineer, because I can program and verify my algorithm and solution on a certain scale clusters and on real huge mass of data. I can learn more details from practice rather than emulate in our tiny clusters.
</p>

<p>
The first reason I want leave is the management of my company seems too chaotic.
I have to spend many hours to writing documentation, make presentations, and maintain the clusters manually.
</p>

<p>
I do not like the ineffective overtime (I had been asked to work until ten o'clock for about two monthes and also worked on Satutarday!), and I hated to be interrupted for something insignificant when I focus to solve some problem or coding. By the way, the long-term business trip is another reason prompts me to seek for new job.
</p>

<p>
I want to find the job that I can focus on the solution of problem and self-improvement. And also I want to balance work and life. I think I can do my job more effective when I had good mood.
</p>

<p>
The third reason is I want to worked with people more brillent and excellent.
These is the reasons I seek for new Job in SAP. I'd like to worked with people brillant and excellent. I like the environemnt of SAP.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3c7eb31" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3c7eb31">Project you want to talk?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3c7eb31">
<p>
I'd like to talk about the project named clj-gdata.
</p>

<p>
I am the leader of this project. I choose clojure as the major language, and use Spark as the compute engineer, use Parquet as the exchange persist storage file type.
</p>

<p>
The project provide three type of service
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>nrepl port: which is TCP port used by clojure interrupt, so we can use editor to connect to remote cluster (spark driver), and submit our code snippet to interrupt. That is absolute wonderful than I expect so that we can dynamic change the runtime without restart or rebuild the large project.</li>

<li>http port: as RESTFul service for frontpage usage. And also I made a simple and sometime ugly page for maintainer. I used Bootstrap, jQuery and AngularJS as the library. The service code is also written in clojure. I had considered to refactor it with ClojureScript (which is a compiler that translate clojure code to javascript, so we can write service and front in the same language).</li>

<li>spark port: which is the redirect of the Spark management page. We can examine the process of current jobs and stages.</li>
</ol>



<p>
The main concept is Task/Model
</p>

<p>
Task is the abstract of the execution of Model.
</p>

<p>
Model is the interface that each developer of analysor or program must be comply. The core method of the Model is the description (metadata), run method, check method, and dynamic ui form generator.
</p>

<p>
The Task is worked in seperated thread in driver and will be submit to Spark's job and run in seperated. The result of task is saved as Parquet file in HDFS, and will record in memory HashTable and also persist metadata in HDFS.
</p>

<p>
Task result can be serailized by use general model such as filter, join, diff and so on. 
</p>

<p>
In my desgin, I want to make a high level abstract of Topology, which can be describe by DAG and parameters, and can be seen as a blackbox model. But until now, I don't have the opptourtiny to implement my desgin.
</p>

<p>
This project involved so many component hadoop ecosystem. And thanks for clojure's NREPL feature and JVM based language. I explore the API of HBase, JDBC, Elasticsearch, Zookeeper, HDFS, Spark carefully. And learned and read source code of part of there project.
</p>

<p>
And also I am fans of Lisp, but I don't have oppournity to use it in real project. But I can proudly say clojure is the best choice for this application.
</p>

<p>
The most hard problem I met was how to seperate resources and tables view over different users. I use dynamic binding to alternate the <b>SparkSession</b> variable by written middleware that parse HTTP json request's user-id.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is how to persuade to use Clojure as the major language.

<h2 id="orgf412f5e">What are you good at and what are you not good at?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf412f5e">
<p>
I'm good at self-learn and explore new things. I can focus on the problem and do my best to get the solution. 
</p>

<p>
There are many things I don't good at. Such as repeated maintain work, meeting. And sometimes I must admit that I'm not good at express the emotion of myself.

<h2 id="orgc60290b">Could you please introduce your hometown to me?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc60290b">
<p>
My hometown is QinYang of GanSu Province. It's abut to Xian'Yang. Not very far away from Xi'an. High-speed rail is about to open.
</p>

<p>
My hometown used to be small town that people lived slowly and peaceful. But in recent years, there're few resource enterprices built there factory. So the city grow rapidly. I can hardly recongnized the new region when I graduated from college.
</p>

<p>
I like my hometown cause it has folk custom. We celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival by make Sachet. There are many snack which are special and can only be eat in my hometown.
</p>

<p>
The most important, there has too many memoizes for me. I like my hometown.
