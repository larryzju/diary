* Design

** Basic

1. Eliminate Data Redundancy
2. Ensure Data Integrity and Accuracy

** Primary Key

Can be a simple key or a composite key which should be
1. Integer if possible
2. AutoNumber
3. not change
4. unique
5. not null

** Relationship

1. one-to-many: foreign key
2. many-to-many: junction table
3. one-to-one

** TODO Normalization

- 1NF :: no list or multiple column in table, use one-to-many relationship instead
- 2NF :: non-key column is fully dependent to primary key
- 3NF :: non-key columns are independent of each other
- Higher Normal Formal :: Doyce, Codee and etc. 

** Integrity Rules

- Primary key (or ites field) :: should not be null
- Referential Integrity Rule :: Foreign key refers to  primary key, be careful to the change of primary key
- Business Logic Integrity :: such as zip code format
