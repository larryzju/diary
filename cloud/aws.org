* EC2

Elastic Compute Cloud is the service we can use to create and run VM
in the cloud.

** Term

- AMI :: Amazon Machine Image, pre-configured server templates to launch an instance

* VPC

Virtual Private Cloud is a virtual networking layer for Amazon EC2
that enable you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network.

By default, there's already a default VPC for your instances. And we
can create our own VPC and subnets.

Feature of EC2-VPC:
- static and persisted private IPv4 addresses to instance
- optionally associated an IPv6 CIDE block to VPC
- optionally assign IPv6 address to instance
- define multiple network interfaces to your instance
- manage security group membership
- egress/ingress filtering
- ACL
- run your instance on single-tenant hardware (?)

VPC information
- subnet
- internet gateway
- route table
  + main route table (by default)
  + custom route table


** Key Concept

- isolate from other virtual network
  - IP address range
  - subnets
    + public subnet that can connect to the internet
    + private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet
  - security groups
  - configure route tables

** Architecture

*** Default VPC

#+CAPTION
[[./images/default-vpc-diagram.png]]
VPC may span multiple zones and there's a separated subnet in each zone.

Each instance that launch into a default subnet has
- a private IPv4 address
- a public IPv4 address

These instances can communicate with the internet through the internet gateway.

*** Nondefault VPC

#+CAPTION: Nondefault VPC Diagram
[[./images/nondefault-vpc-diagram.png]]

- Only private IPv4 addresses are assigned
- instances can communicate with each other (even across the subnets)
- there's no internet gateway been attached to this VPC

**** Enable internet access

#+CAPTION: Internet gateway Diagram
[[./images/internet-gateway-diagram.png]]

1. Attach an internet gateway to this VPC
2. associate an Elastic IP to the instance


**** NAT

For the scenario that to allow outbound traffic only by 
- create a NAT device (has an Elastic IP address and connects to the internet through an internet gateway)
- and map multiple private IPv4 addresses to single IPv4 address


**** TODO IPv6

**** TODO VPN

**** TODO PrivateLink

** Different from traditional network
** TODO VPC Endpoints
** TODO DNS
** TODO Hardware tenancy
** TODO Security Group

Acts as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for its associated instances.

Rules contains:
- inbound rules
- outbound rules

Associate a security group with an instance when launching the instance.

There's a default security group

*** inbound rules

IP + Protocol + Port Range + Comments

- public IPv4 address range of your home network


- Type
  - Protocol
  - Port Range
- Source
  - Custom
  - Anywhere
  - My IP
- Description

*** outbound rules


** How to

*** check the internet gateway info of VPC

*** display the main route table rules 

*** get the custom route table info of VPC

- local route, allow instances to communicate with each other
- outside flow

*** check the default security group

*** get the subnet info of VPC

*** describe VPCs

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
#+END_SRC

Return list of VPC configurations
- CIDR block
- DHCP options set
- Tenancy: if allow tenancy of instances launched into the VPC
- is default
- Owner ID: Aws account

*** expose service inside a non-default VPC

1. create a VPC (specify CIDR)
2. attach an internet gateway
3. create subnet (specify subnet's CIDR)
4. create a custom route table and associate it with the subnet

*** launch an instance
*** assign an elastic IP address to your instance

- specify the subnet
